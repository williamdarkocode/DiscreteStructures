- Lets say we have a set of elements in sequence : {2,5,8,11,...,35}
    - How do we know how many elements are in the sequence? There are 2 ways; Counting, and mapping.


--- Counting --- 
----------------
    - We can count the number of steps. Going from one number in the sequence, to  the next,
        is a step. The absolute difference between those two numbers, is the step size.
    - Hence, the step size for this sequence: {2,5,8,11,....,35} is 3; s=3.
    - Step size can also be negative if teh sequence decreases in order.

    - To find the total number of steps ina sequence, we subtract the first element in the seqeunce,
        from the last element, and devide the result by the ABSOLUTE VALUE of the step size, s.
            --- LAST ELEMENT = 35
            --- FIRST ELEMENT = 2
            --- STEP SIZE = 3

            (LAST - FIRST) / |STEP SIZE|

            (35 - 2) / |3| = 11 total steps

            *** Think of the number of steps as the total number of movements
                you make from the first element in the sequence, to reach the last ***

    - Now, how does the total number of steps in the seqeunce help with finding out how many
        elements are in the set?
            - The total number of elements in the set is always + 1 more than the total number of steps.
            - Therefore, 11 + 1 = 12, so we hve 12 total elements in the set of {2,5,8,11,...,35}

            *** Example ***

                Let our set S = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10}
                    - Step size = 1;
                    - total number of steps = (last - first) / step size
                            (10 - 1) / 1 = 9 total number of steps;
                            takes us 9 movements to get from 1 to 10.
                    - Number of elements in the set is 10

    - This allows us to generalise the format of elements in a sequence;
        - Suppose our set is : {2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}
        - our step size (s) is  = 2; then our total number of steps = (20 - 2)/2 = 9 total steps
        - now to generalise the format of the sequence, lets say, the first element in the sequence is a (which equals 2)

        {a,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}

        but we also want to generalise the format of all the other elements in the sequence.
        To get to 4, we do a + 2; but know our step size (s) is 2, so 4  = a+s 

        Therefore:
            {a,a+s,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}
        
        We repeat the same for 6; to get to 6, twice the step size (s), to a, so 6 = a + 2s (2 + 2(2))

        Therefore:
            {a,a+s,a+2s,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}
        
        And we repeat the same for all other elements in the sequence till we have : 
            {a, a+s , a+2s , a+3s, a+4s , a+5s, a+6s, a+7s, a+8s, a+9s}

        Which is good but,  what we won't always know what the last element is in a sequence, or how many
        elements are in the sequence, hence, we must find a way to generalise.

        We know that at least the first 3 elements must resembles something like this:
            {a, a+s, a+2s, something, something, something,..., lastSomething}

            so: {a, a+s, a+2s,..., lastElement}

            Now, lets focus on the last element in the previous set: a+9s
                We know *a* is the first element
                We know *s* is the step size; but what does the number 9 represent?

                    (20 - 2) / 2 = 9
                    The number 9 represents the total number of steps in the intial seqeunce: {2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16,18,20}

                    And, since we know the total number of steps is the (lastElement - firstElement) / stepSize
                    replace 9 in (a + 9s) with k (which is the total number of steps)

                    so we have (a + ks), however, we'd like to rewrite this in terms of number of elements in the set

                    We know the number of elements in the set is always 1 greater than the total number of steps

                    Which means that the total number of steps, is always 1 less than the total number of elements

                    Threfore, if n represents the total number of elements, the total number of steps will be (n - 1)

                    Leaving our last element in the set to be:

                        a + (n - 1)s

                    our final generalised set notation is:

                        {a, a+s, a+2s,..., a+(n-1)s}    And we're done! lmao.




--- Mapping ---
---------------

    - Given a sequence {a, a+s, a+2s,..., a+(n-1)s}, can you find a equation that maps the sequecne
        to a sequential set of consecutive numbers starting from 1?

    - The known formulae for this is :
        f(x) =  1 + (x-a)/s
    
   - Such seqeunces have a last element b (which is a+(n-1)s), first element a, and step size s,
    number of elements f(b)
